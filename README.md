# Hedging-Iterative-Intergals
This code extends the Wiener-Ito chaos decomposition of class diffusion processes, whose drift and diffusion coefficient are of linear growth. By omitting orthogonality in the chaos expansion, show that every p-integrable functional, for p 2 [1;1), can be represented as a sum of iterated integrals of the underlying process. Using a truncated sum of expansion based neural networks of integrands, the parameters are fed in a machine learning setting, this provides proof of concept that every financial derivative can be approximated arbitrarily in the Lp-sense. Moreover, the hedging strategy of the approximating financial derivative can be computed in closed form.
